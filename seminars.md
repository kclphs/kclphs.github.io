  <summary><b>Can you tell me more about your department?</b></summary>
  
  <br />
  
  The Department of Population Health Sciences is at the forefront of research into population health and primary care, social sciences and policy, epidemiology, informatics, statistics and health economics. 
  Based at King’s College London’s Guy’s and Denmark hill campuses, the department comprises over 160 academics working with large datasets to better understand chronic conditions such as stroke, working to highlight and address inequalities in access to treatment, and working to evaluate therapies and different models of care.

  <summary><b>What is the format of the seminars? How long will I be speaking for?</b></summary>
  
  <br />
  
  Our seminars are one hour long and are held every Wednesday at 3pm in the Autumn and Spring academic terms. 
  After a short introduction from the session chair, speakers usually present for around 40 minutes, but speaking for a shorter period is also fine. 
  Following your presentation, the chair will host a Q&A for you, where staff from our department will be able to ask questions about (and hopefully provide useful input on!) your work.
