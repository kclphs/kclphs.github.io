  <summary><b>Can you tell me more about your department?</b></summary>
  
  <br />
  
  The Department of Population Health Sciences is at the forefront of research into population health and primary care, social sciences and policy, epidemiology, informatics, statistics and health economics. 
  Based at King's College London's Guy's and Denmark hill campuses, the department comprises over 160 academics working with large datasets to better understand chronic conditions such as stroke, working to highlight and address inequalities in access to treatment, and working to evaluate therapies and different models of care.

  <a name="format"></a>

  <summary><b>What is the format of the seminars? How long will I be speaking for?</b></summary>
  
  <br />
  
  Our seminars are an hour long and are held <b>every Wednesday</b> at <b>3pm</b> in the Autumn and Spring academic terms. 
  After a short introduction from the session chair, speakers usually present for around <b>40 minutes</b>, but speaking for a shorter period is also fine. 
  Following your presentation, the chair will host a <b>Q&A</b> for you, where staff from our department will be able to ask questions about (and hopefully provide useful input on) your work.

  <a name="remote"></a>

  <summary><b>Are the seminars remote? Can I speak in person? </b></summary>
  
  <br />
  
  To make the session as accessible to everyone as possible, our seminars are <b>remote</b> by default. 
  Details about how to join the Teams call will be sent to you in advance of the day. 
  We ask that you join the session at <b>2.55</b> if possible, to give you a chance to check your slides, audio and microphone. 
  If you do not feel that your remote setup is suitable to give a presentation, we can arrange for the presentation to be given at King's. 
  Please let us know if this is the case.

  <a name="slots"></a>
  
  <summary><b>I'm trying to book a slot to speak, but I can't make any of the dates shown, what should I do?</b></summary>
  
  <br />
  
  We really appreciate your interest in speaking at our seminar series, and try our best to make available a wide range of dates for you to choose for your talk, as far in advance as possible. 
  While later dates might be preferable, it is important for us to fill the schedule chronologically. 
  We therefore ask for you to select from those dates currently shown, if at all possible. 
  If you have other events scheduled that clash with each of the hour slots shown, please get in touch, and we'll endeavour to let you know as soon as later slots become available.

  <summary><b>What do you need from me in advance?</b></summary>
  
  <br />
  
  We donâ€™t require your slides in advance or anything like that, but a <b>title</b> for your talk, a <b>short biography</b>, and confirmation as to whether you are happy for your talk to be <b>recorded</b> or not, so it can be shared with colleagues who cannot join, would be great.

  <a name="presentation"></a>
  
  <summary><b>Can someone present/share my slides for me during the seminar?</b></summary>
  
  <br />
  
  The only person present at the seminar session in an organisational role will be the session chair, who will have to monitor the attendees throughout the session, pick up any questions that come through and generally ensure everything runs smoothly. 
  As such, we aren't able to share slides on behalf of our speakers, and ask that they do so directly from their own machines.
  As noted, a full check will take place prior to the seminar to ensure this can be done successfully.
  Should the process of screen sharing via Teams be unfamiliar, speakers are directed towards the following guidance: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/show-your-screen-during-a-meeting-90c84e5a-b6fe-4ed4-9687-5923d230d3a7">Show your screen during a meeting</a>.   
  Otherwise, speakers are welcome to nominate a delegate to join the call on the day and share slides for them.
  Please do inform us of this in advance.

  <a name="who"></a>

  <summary><b>Who usually attends the seminars? Will the presentation only be for colleagues at King's?</b></summary>
  
  <br />
  
  Our seminars are attended by people from our department and King's more widely. This usually includes postdocs and academics, as well as students (typically postgraduates). As we are a population health department -- which includes digital health; epidemiology; health economics; health inequalities, societies and systems; primary care; rehabilitation and health; stroke; and medical statistics -- this is the typical background of those attending, however we are also often joined by people with a range of other expertise (e.g. computer science).  

  <br />
  
  While most of our core audience attend from King's, we often welcome external individuals into our seminar audience too.

  <summary><b>Are there certain things I should cover in my talk?</b></summary>
  
  <br />
  
  You are welcome to speak about any aspect of your work that you should wish to. 
  To foster collaboration between yourself and our department, and vice-versa, we have some suggested <a href="kclphs-seminar-template.pptx">template slides</a> for the end of your presentation, which are entirely optional and you may wish to show before you close and we go to Q&A.
